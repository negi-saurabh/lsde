Scihub is a controversial project aiming to set free all scientific publications. We had an archive of 2.4TB with millions of scientific papers, in PDF format. We Extracted the plaintext and author info from all PDF files, and analyzed it to create a DBLP-like overview of this web of science, where papers are linked to each other by citation. Thus, we are interested in creating a scientificis citation database, where all papers are present, inclusive publising date and venue, keywords learned from the fulltext, citations learned from the fulltext. From this data h-score, and citation distributions over time for each author could be calculated.

After the extraction of the author JSONs from the surfsara cluster, we needed to arrange the authors in the files starting from the starting alphabets of their names in order to have a quick traversal and search. We wrote a java script that converts the data JSONs with a pdf data according to the DOI to the JSONs with author names starting alphabet. So, if a publisher has 3 authors, there will be 3 different entries in the newly created JSON files for each other and UI will directly be generated from those JSONs.

The UI runs in a simple web server as the JSON operates on Http protocol and need to host the page in a localhost server. for that we have use chrome web server. for Running we just need to add chrome web server plugin in our chrome and locate the project in that path and access the localhost server with our hosted site.
